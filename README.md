# ConnectMe Laravel Application

ConnectMe is a Laravel-based web application that allows users to connect with others, share information, and collaborate on various projects. This README file provides instructions on how to set up and configure the ConnectMe application on your local development environment.

## Getting Started

To get started with ConnectMe, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your local machine:

- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) (recommended version: 7.4 or higher)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) or [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) for the database
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) for frontend assets

### Installation

1. Clone the ConnectMe repository from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tauseedzaman/connectme.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd connectme
   ```

3. Install PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

5. Generate an application key:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. Configure your database connection settings in the `.env` file. You'll need to set the following variables:

   ```
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=your_database_host
   DB_PORT=your_database_port
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual database information.

7. Migrate the database to create the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

8. Install JavaScript dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

9. Compile frontend assets:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

10. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    By default, the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
